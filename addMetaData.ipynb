Is that right exactly and in fact one of the Best markers of good neurological health when we get older, is consistent, bedtimes, wow, okay, um. I don't want to backtrack, but I did write down something that I think is important for me to resolve or for you to resolve. So I'm going to ask this um people that sleep, nine hours or more perhaps that reflecting an issue. Some underlying issue, perhaps is being a teenager or an adolescent and undergoing a stage of of development where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth. In exception to that, because, yes, I don't recall sleeping a ton when I was a teenager, I had a ton of energy, but I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot yeah like they'll, just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep: should we let them Sleep and sleep and sleep okay, I can sleep okay, so that’s the one exception. What about just like babies? Okay, when you're developing something in your brain or the rest of your body. You really need sleep to help. Organize that I mean sleep is doing really hard work in organizing our brains and and making it develop right, and if we deprive ourselves of sleep we will actually also just I like, like. I said we have a daily clock. We also have a developmental clock and we can miss a developmental window if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to what other things inhibit: growth, hormone release or other components of this first stage of sleep. In other words, if I go to sleep religiously, every night at 10 pm are there things that I perhaps do in the preceding hours or the preceding day like ingest, caffeine or alcohol, that can make that first stage of sleep less effective. Even if I'm going to sleep at the same time, alcohol definitely will do that because alcohol is a REM, sleep suppressant and it even suppresses some of that stage. Two transition to REM with those sleep spindles and those sleep spindles. We didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important for moving memories to our cortex.

Today my guest is Dr Gina Poe, Dr Gina Poe is a professor in the department of Integrative biology and Physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning, in particular how specific patterns of brain activity that are present during specific phases of sleep impact, our ability to learn and remember specific types of information, for instance, procedural information. That is how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks, as well as encoding of emotional memories and discarding emotional memories. Indeed, her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep can act as its own form of trauma therapy discarding the emotional tones of memories. In addition, her laboratory focuses on how specific phases of sleep impact things like the release of growth, hormone growth, hormone, of course, plays critical roles in metabolism and tissue repair, including brain tissue repair, and therefore has critical roles in vitality and Longevity. Today you will learn many things about the relationship between sleep learning, emotionality and growth hormone, one basic, but very important, takeaway. That you'll learn about today, which was news to me, is that it’s not just the duration and depth of your sleep that matter, but actually getting to sleep at relatively the same time. Each night ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release in the first hours of sleep. In fact, if you require, let's say eight hours of sleep per night, but you go to sleep two hours later than your typical bedtime On Any Given night. You actually miss the window for growth hormone release. That’s right! Getting growth hormone release in sleep, which is absolutely critical to our immediate and long-term health, is not a prerequisite of getting sleep even if we are getting enough sleep as Dr Poe explains their critical brain circuit and endocrine. That is hormone circuits that regulate not just the duration and depth and quality and timing of sleep. But when we place our bout of sleep, that is when we go to sleep each night, plus or minus about a half hour or so strongly dictates whether or not we will experience all the health promoting including mind promoting benefits of sleep. Today’s episode covers that and a lot more in substantial detail.
