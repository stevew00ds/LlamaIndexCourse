First, it is important to set moderate goals that are challenging but possible to achieve. It is also important to limit the number of goals pursued at once, as pursuing too many goals can be counterproductive. Additionally, it is crucial to be detailed and specific about the action steps required to achieve the goals. Regularly assessing progress and updating action plans is also recommended, with a weekly assessment being a good starting point. Dopamine plays a role in motivation for goal pursuit, and understanding its function can be helpful. Overall, goal setting and achievement require careful planning, focus, and attention to detail.\", \"name\": \"setting_goals_vector_tool\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Setting and achieving goals is an essential aspect of personal and professional growth. It involves identifying what you want to accomplish and taking the necessary steps to make it happen. Here are some key points to consider when it comes to setting and achieving goals:\\\\n\\\\n1. Set Specific and Measurable Goals: Clearly define what you want to achieve and make sure your goals are measurable. For example, instead of saying \\\\\"I want to exercise more,\\\\\" set a specific goal like \\\\\"I want to exercise for 30 minutes, five days a week.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n2. Make Your Goals Realistic: While it\\'s important to challenge yourself, it\\'s also crucial to set goals that are attainable. Setting unrealistic goals can lead to frustration and demotivation. Consider your abilities, resources, and time constraints when setting your goals.\\\\n\\\\n3. Break Down Your Goals into Actionable Steps: Divide your goals into smaller, manageable tasks or milestones. This will make them less overwhelming and easier to tackle. Create a timeline or action plan to keep yourself on track.\\\\n\\\\n4. Stay Focused and Motivated: Maintain your focus and motivation by regularly reminding yourself of the reasons why you set these goals in the first place. Visualize your success and celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated.\\\\n\\\\n5. Track Your Progress: Regularly assess your progress towards your goals. This will help you stay accountable and make any necessary adjustments to your action plan. Tracking your progress can also provide a sense of accomplishment and keep you motivated.\\\\n\\\\n6. Seek Support and Accountability: Share your goals with others and seek support from friends, family, or a mentor. Having someone to hold you accountable can increase your chances of success. Consider joining a support group or finding an accountability partner to stay motivated.\\\\n\\\\n7. Learn from Setbacks: Setbacks and obstacles are a natural part of the goal-setting process. Instead of getting discouraged, view them as learning opportunities. Analyze what went wrong, adjust your approach if needed, and keep moving forward.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, setting and achieving goals is a continuous process. As you accomplish one goal, set new ones to keep growing and challenging yourself. Stay committed, stay focused, and believe in your ability to achieve what you set out to do.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Tell me about Ketogenic diet\"}], \"stream\": false, \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": null, \"functions\": [{\"name\": \"tools_for_stress_vector_tool\", \"description\": \"Useful for retrieving specific context from a podcast 10 Tools for Managing Stress and Anxiety with Huberman.

So they\\'re eating whatever they normally eat, absolutely \\\\nnonketogenic, giving them a ketone salt or ester, and then noticing immediate and direct \\\\nchanges in the metabolis m of these metabolically compromised brain cells as measured \\\\nby PET imaging. ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are not household pets, by the way. \\\\nSorry, I have -- we have to just -- P-E-T, positron emission tomography, not pets. \\\\nAlthough, I\\'m sure that there are peopl e out there who have their dogs, or cats, or \\\\nwhatever, or their pet kangaroos, whatever you might own, on ketogenic diet. OK. \\\\nCHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. So he\\'s actually moved further. He\\'s done a pilot trial in a \\\\nnursing home actually, where he did not put  the patients on a ketogenic diet. He simply \\\\nreduced carbohydrate consumption at breakfast and lunch. They still got the same \\\\ndinner as everyone else. And simply reducing carbohydrate consumption at breakfast \\\\nand lunch resulted in cognitive improvement in a statistically significant way in some of \\\\nthose subjects. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I love that result. I\\'m sorry, I just have to \\\\nhighlight this. I\\'m a huge believer in directing carbohydrates to specific portions of the \\\\nday when one needs to be less focused a nd alert and yet can replenish glycogen. \\\\nLimiting carbohydrates most of the time during the day, for me, has been a game \\\\nchanger in terms of maintaining alertness, et cetera. I\\'m not aware that I have age -\\\\nrelated cognitive decline. But then again, I would -- people around me may argue \\\\notherwise. CHRIS PALMER: Let me say, you are Andrew Huberman. There is no way \\\\nyou have [LAUGHS] cognitive impairment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although you didn\\'t \\\\nknow me as a six -year-old-- CHRIS PALMER: If you have cognitive impairme nt, we\\'re all \\\\nscrewed. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have plenty  \\\\n \\\\n02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet  \\\\n \\\\nof flaws and impairments -- well over 3,000 documented by people very close to me. But \\\\nthis is very interesting, I think, in the context of  everything we\\'ve been talking about \\\\nbecause could it be that supplementing with liquid ketones or prescribing liquid ketones \\\\nto people who are challenged with mood disorders -- or things of that sort -- could be \\\\nbeneficial, even if they are not willing or a ble to adhere to a ketogenic diet? CHRIS \\\\nPALMER: That is the million dollar question right now. And we don\\'t have good trial data \\\\nto say yes or no. My speculation, my hunch, having tried that clinically with patients, is it \\\\ndoesn\\'t seem to work. It\\'s not t he same thing. The bigger reason for my feeling confident \\\\nin saying that is that we\\'ve had ketone salts and esters available for over a decade now.\\\\n\\\\npage_label: 43\\\\nfile_name: 99_Dr_Chris_Palmer_Diet_&_Nutrition_for_Mental_Health_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_99.pdf\\\\n\\\\nTranscribed by readthatpodcast.com  \\\\nWe have tens of thousands of children and adolescents who are following a strict, \\\\nridiculously strict, ketog enic diet to control their epilepsy. Those kids would love to be off \\\\nthe ketogenic diet. Their parents would love to have them off the ketogenic diet. \\\\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER: \\\\nThere is not one case report of a ny child controlling his or her seizures using exogenous \\\\nketones without also doing the ketogenic diet. I just find it hard to believe that at least \\\\nsome of those people haven\\'t tried it out to see. I do know some patients with bipolar \\\\ndisorder and even sc hizophrenia who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet. \\\\nThey have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones. Their \\\\nsymptoms came back. And so they found that it just wasn\\'t effective. Now, again, those \\\\nare anecdotes. My sci entific speculation about why is because the ketogenic diet is \\\\nactually not necessarily about ketones themselves. Ketones are one of a multifaceted \\\\nstory there. And so when people do a ketogenic diet, they\\'re also improving -- they\\'re \\\\nlowering glucose level s. They\\'re improving insulin signaling. They\\'re ramping up \\\\nmitochondrial biogenesis, in particular, in the liver because mitochondria actually make \\\\nketones. That\\'s where they\\'re made. And they\\'re primarily made in the liver \\\\nmitochondria. So when somebody i s on in a fasting state or on a ketogenic diet, their \\\\nliver mitochondria go through the roof because they\\'re being called to action. It\\'s like, \\\\nhey, body\\'s in starvation mode. Get to work. And so the mitochondria -- the cell senses \\\\nwe need more mitochondria  to process fat to turn it into ketones so that those ketones \\\\ncan get up to the brain and keep the brain fueled, because fatty acids can\\'t fuel the \\\\nbrain. Only ketones can. Now, so my sense is that -- and the gut microbiome changes \\\\nand everything, the chang es in hormones -- so if you\\'re eating a lot of donuts and \\\\ndrinking a bottle of ketones, the donuts are going to prevent your body from lowering \\\\nglucose levels. You\\'re still going to have the high glucose levels from the donuts. You\\'re \\\\nstill going to probabl y have the impaired insulin signaling.

How do you deal with those adjustments? And I \\\\nguess we could expand this conversation and say, wha t about male fertility also? \\\\nBecause some caloric diets seem to -- my understanding is that submaintenance caloric \\\\ndiets, so weight loss diets, will improve testosterone -estrogen ratios in males that are \\\\nobese. But for someone that\\'s not obese, to go on a s ub-caloric diet, that it can start to \\\\nimpair testosterone levels and -- probably not render them infertile but certainly adjust \\\\nthat whole axis. So what about interactions between ketosis, diets, et cetera, and the \\\\nendocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: The real a nswer is, I don\\'t think anybody knows. \\\\nAnd there\\'s not a one -size-fits-all answer because I\\'ve seen examples. And I\\'m aware of \\\\nscience to back up polar opposite conclusions. So the first general observation that I\\'ll \\\\nmake -- I know so many couples, husbands  and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, \\\\nheterosexual couples, who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together -- \\\\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And end up with a baby? No, I\\'m just kidding. [LAUGHS] \\\\nCHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, the men have a much easi er time with it than \\\\nthe women. It\\'s not across the board. But I know so many examples where the women \\\\nsay I couldn\\'t tolerate that diet. It did not make me feel better. It actually made me feel \\\\nworse. And I think in those cases, it probably does relate to  hormones. I\\'m aware of \\\\nanimal models, of mice -- in particular, ketogenic diet in mouse models. One researcher \\\\nshared with me, the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on \\\\nthe ketogenic diet. Whereas, the mice on the standard d iet were just having babies right \\\\nand left. And it was just shocking, the difference. On the surface, it makes sense. The \\\\nketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state. Women who are trying to reproduce should \\\\nnot be fasting. If your body is in a fasting s tate, it probably does not want to expend \\\\nresources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things, to creating a baby \\\\nbecause your very life is being threatened by, quote unquote, \\\\\"fasting\\\\\" or starvation. \\\\nThat even though the ketogenic diet i s a sustainable, nonstarvation diet, we\\'re really \\\\nusing that diet to trick the body into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state. And \\\\nso just from a kind of evolutionary stance, it makes sense that women\\'s bodies may \\\\nactually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a \\\\nwoman should not be having a baby when she\\'s starving to death. I know of examples of \\\\nwomen who are the opposite, though, who have benefited dramatically and \\\\ntremendously from the ketogenic diet, ha ve put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full \\\\nremission. And I do actually know of one case, at least one case.

It involves identifying what you want to accomplish and taking the necessary steps to make it happen. Here are some key points to consider when it comes to setting and achieving goals:\\\\n\\\\n1. Set Specific and Measurable Goals: Clearly define what you want to achieve and make sure your goals are measurable. For example, instead of saying \\\\\"I want to exercise more,\\\\\" set a specific goal like \\\\\"I want to exercise for 30 minutes, five days a week.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n2. Make Your Goals Realistic: While it\\'s important to challenge yourself, it\\'s also crucial to set goals that are attainable. Setting unrealistic goals can lead to frustration and demotivation. Consider your abilities, resources, and time constraints when setting your goals.\\\\n\\\\n3. Break Down Your Goals into Actionable Steps: Divide your goals into smaller, manageable tasks or milestones. This will make them less overwhelming and easier to tackle. Create a timeline or action plan to keep yourself on track.\\\\n\\\\n4. Stay Focused and Motivated: Maintain your focus and motivation by regularly reminding yourself of the reasons why you set these goals in the first place. Visualize your success and celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated.\\\\n\\\\n5. Track Your Progress: Regularly assess your progress towards your goals. This will help you stay accountable and make any necessary adjustments to your action plan. Tracking your progress can also provide a sense of accomplishment and keep you motivated.\\\\n\\\\n6. Seek Support and Accountability: Share your goals with others and seek support from friends, family, or a mentor. Having someone to hold you accountable can increase your chances of success. Consider joining a support group or finding an accountability partner to stay motivated.\\\\n\\\\n7. Learn from Setbacks: Setbacks and obstacles are a natural part of the goal-setting process. Instead of getting discouraged, view them as learning opportunities. Analyze what went wrong, adjust your approach if needed, and keep moving forward.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, setting and achieving goals is a continuous process. As you accomplish one goal, set new ones to keep growing and challenging yourself.

Here are some key points to know about the ketogenic diet:\\\\n\\\\n1. Macronutrient Composition: The ketogenic diet is characterized by a high fat, moderate protein, and very low carbohydrate intake. Typically, the macronutrient breakdown is around 70-75% fat, 20-25% protein, and 5-10% carbohydrates.\\\\n\\\\n2. Inducing Ketosis: By significantly reducing carbohydrate intake, the body is forced to enter a metabolic state called ketosis. In ketosis, the liver produces ketones from fat breakdown, which become the primary source of energy for the body instead of glucose.\\\\n\\\\n3. Benefits of Ketosis: The ketogenic diet has been used for decades to manage epilepsy in children and adolescents who do not respond well to medication. It has also shown potential benefits for weight loss, blood sugar control, and improving insulin sensitivity. Some studies suggest that the ketogenic diet may have neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects.\\\\n\\\\n4. Food Choices: The ketogenic diet emphasizes foods that are high in healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts and seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, and fatty fish. It restricts or eliminates foods high in carbohydrates, including grains, legumes, starchy vegetables, sugary foods, and most fruits.\\\\n\\\\n5. Potential Side Effects: When transitioning to a ketogenic diet, some people may experience temporary side effects, often referred to as the \\\\\"keto flu.\\\\\" These can include fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, and constipation. It is important to stay hydrated, consume adequate electrolytes, and gradually reduce carbohydrate intake to minimize these symptoms.\\\\n\\\\n6. Individual Variations: It\\'s important to note that the ketogenic diet may not be suitable for everyone. Some individuals may experience difficulty adhering to the strict dietary restrictions, while others may have underlying health conditions that require a different approach to nutrition. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before starting any new diet.\\\\n\\\\n7. Long-Term Sustainability: The ketogenic diet can be effective for short-term weight loss and certain medical conditions. However, its long-term sustainability and potential effects on overall health are still being studied. It is important to consider the balance of nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and fiber, that may be limited on a ketogenic diet.\\\\n\\\\nRemember, the ketogenic diet is a significant dietary change and should be approached with caution. It is essential to work with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to ensure nutritional adequacy and monitor any potential side effects or interactions with medications.\"\\n      },\\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"usage\": {\\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 983,\\n    \"completion_tokens\": 540,\\n    \"total_tokens\": 1523\\n  }\\n}\\n' headers='{\\'Date\\': \\'Thu, 28 Sep 2023 13:03:22 GMT\\', \\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\', \\'Transfer-Encoding\\': \\'chunked\\', \\'Connection\\': \\'keep-alive\\', \\'access-control-allow-origin\\': \\'*\\', \\'Cache-Control\\': \\'no-cache, must-revalidate\\', \\'openai-model\\': \\'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\\', \\'openai-organization\\': \\'user-k8oyxwpy2ln43xyfwaaakcre\\', \\'openai-processing-ms\\': \\'27144\\', \\'openai-version\\': \\'2020-10-01\\', \\'strict-transport-security\\': \\'max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains\\', \\'x-ratelimit-limit-requests\\': \\'3500\\', \\'x-ratelimit-limit-tokens\\': \\'90000\\', \\'x-ratelimit-remaining-requests\\': \\'3499\\', \\'x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens\\': \\'89005\\', \\'x-ratelimit-reset-requests\\': \\'17ms\\', \\'x-ratelimit-reset-tokens\\': \\'663ms\\', \\'x-request-id\\': \\'3255b551db1f0c627d9e9f2799d8a477\\', \\'CF-Cache-Status\\': \\'DYNAMIC\\', \\'Server\\': \\'cloudflare\\', \\'CF-RAY\\': \\'80dc2efc9dad5a48-VIE\\', \\'Content-Encoding\\': \\'gzip\\', \\'alt-svc\\': \\'h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\\'}' message='API response body'\n"

CHRIS PALMER: \\nThere is not one case report of a ny child controlling his or her seizures using exogenous \\nketones without also doing the ketogenic diet. I just find it hard to believe that at least \\nsome of those people haven't tried it out to see. I do know some patients with bipolar \\ndisorder and even sc hizophrenia who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet. \\nThey have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones. Their \\nsymptoms came back. And so they found that it just wasn't effective. Now, again, those \\nare anecdotes. My sci entific speculation about why is because the ketogenic diet is \\nactually not necessarily about ketones themselves. Ketones are one of a multifaceted \\nstory there. And so when people do a ketogenic diet, they're also improving -- they're \\nlowering glucose level s. They're improving insulin signaling. They're ramping up \\nmitochondrial biogenesis, in particular, in the liver because mitochondria actually make \\nketones. That's where they're made. And they're primarily made in the liver \\nmitochondria. So when somebody i s on in a fasting state or on a ketogenic diet, their \\nliver mitochondria go through the roof because they're being called to action. It's like, \\nhey, body's in starvation mode. Get to work. And so the mitochondria -- the cell senses \\nwe need more mitochondria  to process fat to turn it into ketones so that those ketones \\ncan get up to the brain and keep the brain fueled, because fatty acids can't fuel the \\nbrain. Only ketones can. Now, so my sense is that -- and the gut microbiome changes \\nand everything, the chang es in hormones -- so if you're eating a lot of donuts and \\ndrinking a bottle of ketones, the donuts are going to prevent your body from lowering \\nglucose levels. You're still going to have the high glucose levels from the donuts. You're \\nstill going to probabl y have the impaired insulin signaling.

How do you deal with those adjustments? And I \\nguess we could expand this conversation and say, wha t about male fertility also? \\nBecause some caloric diets seem to -- my understanding is that submaintenance caloric \\ndiets, so weight loss diets, will improve testosterone -estrogen ratios in males that are \\nobese. But for someone that\\'s not obese, to go on a s ub-caloric diet, that it can start to \\nimpair testosterone levels and -- probably not render them infertile but certainly adjust \\nthat whole axis. So what about interactions between ketosis, diets, et cetera, and the \\nendocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: The real a nswer is, I don\\'t think anybody knows. \\nAnd there\\'s not a one -size-fits-all answer because I\\'ve seen examples. And I\\'m aware of \\nscience to back up polar opposite conclusions. So the first general observation that I\\'ll \\nmake -- I know so many couples, husbands  and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, \\nheterosexual couples, who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together -- \\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And end up with a baby? No, I\\'m just kidding. [LAUGHS] \\nCHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, the men have a much easi er time with it than \\nthe women. It\\'s not across the board. But I know so many examples where the women \\nsay I couldn\\'t tolerate that diet. It did not make me feel better. It actually made me feel \\nworse. And I think in those cases, it probably does relate to  hormones. I\\'m aware of \\nanimal models, of mice -- in particular, ketogenic diet in mouse models. One researcher \\nshared with me, the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on \\nthe ketogenic diet. Whereas, the mice on the standard d iet were just having babies right \\nand left. And it was just shocking, the difference. On the surface, it makes sense. The \\nketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state. Women who are trying to reproduce should \\nnot be fasting. If your body is in a fasting s tate, it probably does not want to expend \\nresources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things, to creating a baby \\nbecause your very life is being threatened by, quote unquote, \"fasting\" or starvation. \\nThat even though the ketogenic diet i s a sustainable, nonstarvation diet, we\\'re really \\nusing that diet to trick the body into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state. And \\nso just from a kind of evolutionary stance, it makes sense that women\\'s bodies may \\nactually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a \\nwoman should not be having a baby when she\\'s starving to death. I know of examples of \\nwomen who are the opposite, though, who have benefited dramatically and \\ntremendously from the ketogenic diet, ha ve put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full \\nremission.
